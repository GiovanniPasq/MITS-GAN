# MITS-GAN
This is the implementation of our submitted Artificial Intelligence in Medicine 2024 work 'MITS-GAN: Safeguarding Medical Imaging from Tampering with Generative Adversarial Networks'. This study introduces MITS-GAN, a novel approach to prevent tampering in medical images, with a specific focus on CT scans. The approach disrupts the output of the attacker's CT-GAN architecture by introducing imperceptible but yet precise perturbations. The original paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09624.pdf). <br>
